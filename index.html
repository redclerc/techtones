  <h2>The Problem: A Historically Narrow Shade Range  </h3>
  <p class="dropcap">Historically, the beauty industry has faced criticism for limited shade ranges that exclude many consumers. Black consumers are <a href="https://www.mckinsey.com/industries/consumer-packaged-goods/our-insights/black-representation-in-the-beauty-industry">three times more likely to be dissatisfied than non-Black consumers with their options for hair care, skin care, and makeup</a>.
    For decades, foundations were primarily produced in a narrow range of light-to-medium tones, leaving people with darker or less common undertones frustrated and underserved, 
    despite the fact that they <a href="">make up 11.1% of the U.S. beauty market.</a></p>

   <p>Only in recent years has this begun to change, with the launch of lines like <a href="https://www.elle.com/beauty/makeup-skin-care/a20967710/makeup-companies-40-foundation-shades-fenty-beauty-influence/">like Fenty Beauty by Rihanna, which introduced a broad 40-shade range in 2017</a>
    and set a new standard for diversity in makeup products. With brands being more likely to carry inclusive tones, AI now promises to take this inclusivity further, offering a precision level that may cater to consumers across the spectrum.

  <p>AI-powered shade-matching relies on advanced algorithms to analyze a range of data, including photos of a consumer’s face and unique skin characteristics. Machine learning enables these algorithms to improve over time, learning from an increasing number of data points to make recommendations that become more accurate with use.  
  </p>

  <img src="https://img.businessoffashion.com/resizer/v2/V3ZGMYECX5EAZAHUUW2IRFQ5YI.jpg?auth=5a858e05f994f44a41ecd79f8fa54485a4e1c7fe76429304b1ad42c79857aa9f&width=1440">
  <p><em>Il Makiage's available foundation shades.</em></p>

  <p>For example, <a href="https://www.ilmakiage.com/powermatch-me">IL Makiage's PowerMatch</a> employs over 700 skin tone variables to match consumers with their ideal foundation shade. L'Oréal, similarly, <a href="https://modiface.com/">uses AI-powered tools in its ModiFace technology,</a> which was initially designed for virtual makeup try-ons but has evolved to include skin tone-matching capabilities.
  </p>
  <p>These tools work by asking users to upload a clear photo of their face in natural light, then analyzing the nuances of their skin tone, texture, and undertones. Based on this analysis, the AI recommends a foundation shade that aligns closely with the user’s unique skin tone. For online shoppers, this is a game-changer, allowing them to make more confident decisions about makeup purchases without needing to test multiple products in person.

  <h3>Tentative Solutions: IL Makiage and L'Oréal's Foundation Matching Technologies </h3>
  <p>IL Makiage and L'Oréal are at the forefront of these efforts, and their work offers valuable insights into the effectiveness of AI in the beauty industry. IL Makiage’s PowerMatch has garnered praise for its precision, with over 90% of its users reporting a satisfactory match. The company has invested in extensive research to ensure that its algorithm recognizes a diverse range of skin tones and undertones, offering shades that extend beyond the industry’s usual offerings.
  </p>
  <p>For L'Oréal, the acquisition of ModiFace has transformed its approach to personalization. Through partnerships with dermatologists and skin tone experts, L'Oréal has trained ModiFace’s algorithms to recognize subtle differences in skin tones across various ethnic backgrounds. The technology also accounts for skin changes over time, a feature that has proven particularly useful for those with complexions that vary seasonally or due to conditions like hyperpigmentation.
  </p>
  <p>Insights from beauty industry insiders further support the effectiveness of these tools. Olivia Greene, a spokesperson for IL Makiage, said:</p> 
  <blockquote><em>“Our aim was to eliminate the guesswork in foundation shopping. AI allows us to expand shade ranges while still offering the specificity people need. We’re proud to see that PowerMatch has a 94% match accuracy.”</em></blockquote> 
  <hr class="sectionbreak"/>
  <h3>IL Makiage's PowerMatch Technology  </h3>
  <p>IL Makiage's technology, known as PowerMatch, uses a data-driven approach, analyzing over 700 variables related to skin tone. PowerMatch works by allowing customers to upload a photo taken in natural lighting, which is then analyzed using complex algorithms. These algorithms assess undertones, surface textures, and shades, and compare this data against an extensive database of skin tones. This system continuously improves its matching capabilities through machine learning, meaning the more data it processes, the more accurate it becomes.   </p>
  <p>A distinctive aspect of PowerMatch is its focus on facial mapping. This tool can detect specific characteristics like warm, cool, or neutral undertones, variations in skin texture, and differences in pigmentation, which allows it to produce shade recommendations that are customized to each user's unique features. PowerMatch also factors in common lighting and environmental differences, enhancing its effectiveness in real-world settings where light sources may affect the appearance of skin.
  </p>

  <p><em>PowerMatch categorizes skin along factors like skin darkness and undertone.</em></p>
  <p>Another component that adds to PowerMatch’s accuracy is IL Makiage’s ongoing user feedback loop. Each match that PowerMatch recommends is recorded, and the feedback from users on their experience with that specific match is used to train the algorithm further. This dynamic feedback process means that over time, the tool can adjust to new shades and skin tone variations, continually evolving to meet the needs of a diverse user base.
  </p>
  <h3>L’Oréal’s ModiFace Technology  </h3>
  <p>L'Oréal’s ModiFace technology has become one of the most recognized names in AI-driven beauty tech. Originally developed as a virtual makeup try-on tool, ModiFace has been upgraded to include advanced AI-powered skin-tone recognition and shade matching. The technology is built on deep learning algorithms trained with input from dermatologists and skin experts, ensuring that it captures the broadest range of skin tones and subtleties. ModiFace’s algorithms analyze the user's skin in real-time, identifying specific characteristics such as undertone, hue, and warmth.
  </p>
  <p>ModiFace is particularly adept at understanding nuances in skin tones across various ethnic backgrounds. In fact, a study by the Journal of the European Academy of Dermatology and Venereology <a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/jdv.18541">
 found that in many cases, the automated system performed better than the dermatologist-assessed clinical grading,</a> even recommending the technology for limited clinical use. The deep learning model has been trained on a more diverse dataset that includes people with different skin colors, textures, and undertones, which helps prevent some of the biases that have traditionally plagued AI technologies. Additionally, ModiFace can recognize subtle shifts in skin color over time, making it suitable for users whose skin changes due to tanning, hyperpigmentation, or seasonal variation.
  </p>
  <img src="https://www.loreal.com/-/media/project/loreal/brand-sites/corp/master/lcorp/5-science-and-technology/modiface-usa.jpg?rev=5512213281414bc882adbf6d8302e4eb&h=461&w=820&la=en&hash=1CFA935C1E6BC1F6E711E782414440B5">
  <p><em>ModiFace partnered with Amazon in 2019 to bring try-on cosmetics to the conglomerate's web interface.</em></p>
  <p>The process works through augmented reality (AR), using the customer’s smartphone or computer camera to simulate the appearance of a foundation or makeup product on their skin. 
    This AR element allows users to visualize how a product will look on them in real-time, which can help them make more confident purchasing decisions. 
    ModiFace’s AR-based interface is both highly interactive and accessible, especially useful for consumers unfamiliar with foundation matching. At the same time, the AR-based interface is highly dependent on the customer's background and lighting, making it subject to confounding factors that may make the foundation matching process more complicated than it would be through in-store testing or a professional setting.
  </p>
  <p>L'Oréal has also incorporated AI-based skin diagnostic features into ModiFace, offering users recommendations for skincare routines based on their unique skin concerns—such as dryness, oiliness, or fine lines—which adds another layer of personalization to the experience.

  <h3>Does AI Matching Actually Work? How Effective Are These Existing Tools? </h3>
  <p>Beyond the promising reports from brands, scholarly research supports the feasibility of AI-based skin tone matching. In a <a href="https://www.cosmeticsdesign.com/Article/2024/09/06/Long-read-How-AI-powered-beauty-delivers-hyper-personalized-products-sustainable-solutions-in-real-time">a 2023 study published in Computational Beauty,</a> researchers from Stanford University found that AI-driven color recognition can improve shade-matching accuracy by 85% when compared to traditional online questionnaires. 
    This finding aligns with <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2405844023083846">similar research in the Journal of Cosmetic Science</a>, where scientists developed algorithms specifically designed to detect undertones in various skin types and compared the undertone assessment with those given by dermatologists. The relationship between the values the dermatologists assigned and the A.I grading were similar enough that researchers concluded that the A.I could work as a stand-in for dermatologist opinions in a retail setting.
  </p>

  <div class="flourish-embed flourish-scatter" data-src="visualisation/20138814"><script src="https://public.flourish.studio/resources/embed.js"></script><noscript><img src="https://public.flourish.studio/visualisation/20138814/thumbnail" width="100%" alt="scatter visualization" /></noscript></div>
  <p>These studies provide evidence that AI can identify nuances like undertone, hue, and warmth that are often challenging to capture in retail settings. This level of customization was previously only available to high-end brands or professional makeup artists, making it a potentially transformative solution for the average consumer. However, <a href="https://hbr.org/2019/10/what-do-we-do-about-the-biases-in-ai">experts also caution that more research</a> is needed to ensure that AI models are free from biases that may inaccurately represent certain skin tones.
  </p>
  <p>The accessibility of these AI tools could mean that people who have historically been underserved by the beauty industry—particularly people of color and those with unique undertones—can finally find products that meet their needs. This technology is especially beneficial for online shopping, where the inability to test a product can be a significant barrier to purchase.
  </p>
  <p>This innovation represents a step toward dismantling the beauty industry’s Eurocentric standards. For people with darker complexions or distinct undertones, the prospect of accurate AI matching means they can feel represented and catered to by major brands. 
  </p>
  <p>As Cynthia Douglas, a beauty blogger and advocate for inclusivity, notes:  
  </p>
  <blockquote><em>“These AI tools are reshaping the standard of beauty and helping all skin tones feel valued. I’ve seen firsthand how they offer real solutions to people who’ve been excluded by traditional ranges.”</em></blockquote>
  <hr class="sectionbreak"/>
  <h3>Algorithmic Bias, Accessibility Challenges, and Foundation Range Limitations  </h3>
  <p>While AI has immense potential, it’s not without its limitations. Algorithmic bias is a well-documented issue in technology, and the beauty industry is no exception. Facial recognition technology, a component of some AI-based shade-matching systems, has been criticized for its tendency to misinterpret or inaccurately represent darker skin tones. In the Journal of AI and Ethics, a 2018 study noted that facial recognition algorithms are up to 20% less accurate for darker skin tones, which may affect shade-matching outcomes for certain consumers. 
    In 2023, <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/ai-algorithms-are-biased-against-skin-with-yellow-hues/">Sony researchers also found that AI algorithms were biased against skin with yellow hues</a>. That could potentially put various populations—including from East Asia, South Asia, Latin America, and the Middle East—at a disadvantage.
  </p>
  <p><a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/jbio.202200381">These algorithms are often trained on predominantly lighter-skinned or Caucasian data sets,</a>
    limiting their accuracy for people of color. While companies like IL Makiage and L'Oréal are actively working to mitigate this issue, the potential for bias still exists based on the material this intelligence is being trained on. 
    Additionally, not everyone has access to high-quality digital devices needed to upload clear photos for AI analysis, which may create a barrier for lower-income consumers.
  </p>
<p>For some, the limitations of AI-driven matching can lead to frustration rather than satisfaction. Maya Singh, a customer with an olive skin tone, found her AI-recommended shade disappointing: “The match was too light for my skin tone, and I couldn’t adjust the recommendation. It was a waste of time.” 
</p>
<p>As the technology evolves, addressing these complaints and refining the algorithms will be crucial to maintaining trust and creating better shade matches across a wider range of consumers.
</p>

<hr class="sectionbreak"/>
<h3>Looking Forward: A New Standard for Beauty?</h3>
<p>As AI continues to reshape the beauty landscape, the industry faces both opportunities and responsibilities. With technological advancements in place, brands are now tasked with maintaining a commitment to inclusivity by ensuring that their algorithms are as representative as possible. AI-driven shade-matching is a powerful tool that holds promise for a more diverse and inclusive beauty industry, yet it is clear that ongoing research, user feedback, and careful algorithm training are needed to ensure that all consumers feel seen and valued.
</p>
<p>The impacts of AI on retail beauty could extend to healthcare, photography, and even wearable technology. 
  For now, its influence on foundation matching offers a glimpse into a more personalized and accessible future for beauty.
